### Introduction :

Traffic accidents have become one of the most common causes of death and injury in saudi arabia . Traffic accidents are major causes of illness (morbidity) and death (mortality).
These accidents are a very serious public health problem that requires concerted efforts for effective and sustainable prevention .



### Problems :

Increasing the traffic accidents in saudi arabia   .

### Datasets Description :

Two data sets were given one contains the data set for the licenses per regions and the other one contains the accidents and the casualties per region.
1- Traffic Accident Data set
2- Driving License Data set

|y| float | Driving_Licenses / Traffic_Accidents | y coordinate for region |



#### Executive Summary:


 In the beginning I consider that the driving licenses has the affected to the traffic accidents that causes the injures and dead   and  Through analysis the data I found out  in 2016-2017 the highest  traffic accident was  in Makkah region and the highest driving licenses was in Riyadh region  .
From this we can't say that the driving licenses could affect to the  traffic accident. 





#### conclusions and recommendations:

I recommended to provide a Strict law enforcement of traffic violations so it can highly affect the total number of accident and hence decrease the numbers of injuries and deaths. Also awareness social campaigns that showcase the injuries and deaths caused by traffic violation also is important to remind people that they must obey the rules and respect the road and the other drives to avoid any loss.
